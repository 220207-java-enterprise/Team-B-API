# High Level Git Workflow
1. Protect main branch with branch protection rule. 
   - Requires pull requests to be reviewed by another member before merging.
2. Work in feature branches that reflect different aspects of application functionality.
   - I.E. feature/reimbursement-post-endpoint/Aidan-Carlos
3. Review pull requests and resolve merge conflicts as a team.
